VOICeCmd is a utility that allows remote control of the vOICe from the commandline. The vOICe uses windows messages as a remote control mechanism. This approach though easy-to-use cannot be used by the average user primarily because it involves a lot of programming. This utility is a wrapper around that functionality. Now, the entire interface of the vOICe can be accessed using simple to use commandline commands.
